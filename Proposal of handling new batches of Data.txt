Proposal 1: Using Auto Loader for Future Improvement

1) In the long run, I would propose using Databricks Auto Loader because it makes the whole ingestion process much more reliable and      automated.

2) Auto Loader automatically picks up only new files when they arrive in the raw data folder.

3) It keeps track of what has already been processed, so we never accidentally load the same file twice or override older data.

4) If the input schema changes (like a new column is added), Auto Loader can handle it gracefully without breaking the pipeline.

5) From there, we can continue with the Bronze → Silver → Gold pipeline like before.

*****This approach is much more scalable and production-ready, especially if the project grows and more data sources get added.***

Proposal 2: Handling New Batches of Input Data without Overwriting Previous Transactions


Raw Ingestion (Bronze Layer): 

1) Always append new incoming batches instead of overwriting.

2) Keep original raw files intact for traceability.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Data Cleaning & Deduplication (Silver Layer): 


1) Use business keys such as CLAIM_ID or CONTRACT_ID to identify unique records.

2) Apply upserts (insert new, update changed) so that only new or updated records are processed.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Transaction History & Snapshots (Gold Layer):

1) Maintain the latest valid version of each transaction.

2) Preserve historical versions for audit and compliance.

Batch Identification:

1) Introduce a batch_id or ingestion_timestamp column to distinguish records across different loads.

2) Enables debugging and rollback in case of incorrect data loads.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Result:

Ensures no loss of historical data, prevents accidental overwrites, and guarantees consistent reporting while still handling new incoming data efficiently.
