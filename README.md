# Claims-Contracts-Data-Engineering-Project
Designed and built a production-style data pipeline in Databricks following the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to process and transform claims and contracts data.  Ingested raw data into Delta tables (Bronze).  Cleaned, standardized, and deduplicated in Silver using Delta MERGE.
